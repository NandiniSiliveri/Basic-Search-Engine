- Git
- Visual Studio Code with Java Extension Pack

## Project Structure
- src/ : Contains the source code for the search engine, including the main file and helper classes for data structure operations.
- data/ : Includes the `topics.txt` file, which stores the searchable topics and their descriptions.


## Files Overview
- **`Main.java`**: The entry point of the application that handles user interaction and initiates the search process.
